-thank you so much and welcome
-this is just an incredibly exciting event for all of us in Google Cloud
-,for all of us at Google,
-..I would say
-you know the guy that was mic'ing me was telling me that there was a queue around the block
-,that we had a block buster, and I'm sorry for the queue,
-,but we're pretty happy to have all of you here to be at capacity at 10,000
-all the people live streaming
-I really regret the live streamers couldn't see the surround of that amazing animation that we just showed

-Google -- I mean 'cloud' -- does anybody not agree it's the biggest thing going on in I.T. right now?
-Woo!
-Google Cloud -- I mean the adoption of _cloud_ in general I believe it must be accelerating
-,I know at Google Cloud this year we've seen unbelievable acceleration
-,and the quality of our customer conversations are really changing
-for a while it was more:
-:"let's use BigQuery",
-,:"let's do our data analytics",
-,:"let's do a machine learning project"
-,but just 2 weeks ago I met with 5 customers over the course of the week
-,and 3 of them said "hey I want to do a full lift-and-shift",
-,I just want to move everything to the cloud
-,and it was only last September that we actually started calling ourselves Google Cloud
-..all that we do from the infrastructure to the workplace collaboration,
-.,productivity, and even the mobile devices in the enterprise

-It's been a remarkable year - our engineers have done over 500 releases
-,these are releases to get functionality to our customers
-,these are new innovations these are inventions
-,and just ongoing improvement in all that we do
-..security, reliability, efficiencies...

-Cloud is just an incredible place to be working right now
-,it's basically revolutionising...
-,it's sort of where a lot of the revolution -- the digital revolution -- for every industry is going on
-In financial services, tremendous efficiencies in how data is processed
-,or how the banks can talk directly to their customers

-In health, we're seeing a revolution in diagnosis,
-,in prediction of patient outcomes
-,and retail -- particularly exciting area -- taking billions of dollars out as we revolutionise the store of the future

-Media, something Google is particularly well situated to do
-,and energy, manufacturing, optimising, reducing the energy usage
-,making the factories/the manufacturing more efficient

-It's incredibly exciting to be a part of this,
-,we have such interesting customers
-,we have a customer planet labs(?) that's taking pictures of the entire Earth every 3 hours
-,and that's going on Google Cloud

-I think the cloud... you know it's no longer sort of a utility for surplus peak capacity
-,it's no longer a place just to store things,
-,you know it...
-startups it's where they start but it's not solely for a startup to figure out what...
-,...what demand they're gonna have before they spend any money
-workplace productivity has really moved beyond sending files around via email
-,and the cloud is really what's increasingly giving customers their competitive advantage
-,?and what's important there?
-:well paramount is security
-,from the board level on down, nobody...
-,you know everybody really cares about security
-,and I'll say a little more about security at scale in a little bit.

-It's about cost, performance, effectivity(?)
-,flexible costs, no lock-in,
-,and it's about reliability
-,and I'm just (because of all the interest in reliability lately),
-,I'm just gonna say a few words

-you know, you take Google search,
-,it was designed, it runs as you see when you do a search,
-,it runs at five 9ths of availability
-..that's 99.999% uptime
-,and our cloud that's how we've designed our cloud,
-,we're making it really easy for our customers to design and deploy for that kind of reliability
-,distributed, no single point of failure
-,and I'm really proud, I just learned yesterday that we were recognised as being...
-,...as having the highest availability of any cloud over the course of 2016

-{applause}

-thank you -- I think 2017 will be promising too

-{laughter}

-we're putting in a lot of effort across the board,
-,across our entire systems,
-,with the unbelievably excellent engineers we have
-,to keep giving you more nines

-?What else?
-:the world -- customers -- are getting increasingly focussed on data,
-,you want the world's best data analytics, the world's best machine learning
-,this is definitely a Google strength,
-,and then finally workplace culture.
-You know really it's about real-time workplace collaboration,
-,it's about finding ways to get the bureaucracy out of a company,
-,because everybody's got to move fast now,
-,and we've got the technology tools to do that.

-So over the next 3 days you're going to hear from our engineers,
-,they're gonna tell you about our products,
-,they're gonna give you our road maps,
-,you're gonna see lots of demos,
-,our customer facing people will help you navigate Google Cloud,
-,and you're also in this keynote going to hear from our customers.
-Everyone at Google Cloud is so incredibly proud of customers that we have here today
-,that we've been working with over the course of the year
-,6 customers and a major partner.

-So now I just want to pause,
-,I'm wearing my red ribbon,
-,I want to acknowledge that it's _International Women's Day_ today,
-..{applause}
-.,wow...
-,I have to say, that response is pretty exciting
-,you know... this industry... I think I've been incredibly fortunate
-,but it was sort of an industry where I was lucky,
-,and I kind of chose to be kind of oblivious to what was going on,
-,and now we're in an environment where women are just increasingly having a huge impact,
-,and adding a lot of value to our industry
-,and women are celebrated if they raise their hand and they say:
-:"hey, you're missing my value",
-,:"you're not recognising what I'm doing"
-,and at Google, we strive -- at Google Cloud -- to have an environment where noone needs to raise their hand,
-,but no matter what it's completely safe to do that. Okay.

-Um... you know I really look forward to the day when this audience is maybe 50% women
-,it's more fun to have diversity

-So... shifting gears,
-,now I want to bring on our next keynote speaker.
-It's my phenomenal privilege to introduce our incredibly smart, compassionate, and just great leader,
-,Sundar Pichai.
