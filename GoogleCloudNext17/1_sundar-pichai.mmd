-thank you
-,this is a big crowd
-,I've done many I/O presentations here,
-,and it feels like a bigger crowd than Google I/O
-,so thank you all for joining today, it's great to be here.

-Google was founded on a mission to organise the world's information
-,and make it universally accessible and useful.
-Over many years, we've had the privilege to create products that have served billions of consumers across the world.
-To do that, we've had to engage pretty much every branch of computer science
-,and we've had breakthroughs along the way.
-It has led us to breakthroughs in cloud computing technology,
-,collaboration software,
-,analytics,
-,things which are now transforming businesses everywhere.

-So with Google Cloud, we now offer businesses Google-quality computing, security, and business tools
-,and it is an extraordinarily big bet for us
-,both as a platform, internally for our own innovation,
-,but also as a way of bringing our infrastructure to serve the needs of businesses across the world.

-Our customers and partners will see many ways to leverage all of Google:
-:be it _Google Maps_,
-,:_Android_,
-,:_YouTube_,
-,:our devices ecosystem,
-,and we'll deliver it over the most efficient, high performing, and secure core computing resources

-For over 15 years, we've also been investing in machine learning and A.I.
-,and as businesses increasingly shift online, and create more information,
-,they can leverage these A.I and machine learning tools,
-,to understand the information and build better products
-,that delight more customers.

-Above all, we are excited to see what you all will create with our products and services.
-When we ship things on the consumer side,
-,we always get surprised in _how_ they use our technology in a thousand unexpected ways.
-It makes us better as a company.
-With Google Cloud, we hope to have the same journey,
-,we hope to grow and learn alongside you.
-Partners already have pushed us to add more ways to collaborate beyond videoconferencing.
-They've exposed us to more real world scaling needs
-,for example the demand that retailers like _Home Depot_ get on Black Friday.
-They've shown us exciting new use cases for Google products,
-,you'll see what eBay has done with Google Home as an example.

-In many ways, to me Google Cloud is a natural extension of our mission to make information accessible and useful
-..we're just doing it for businesses.
-It means increasing the availability
-,and lowering the cost of data storage and computing resources.
-It means making it easier for businesses to understand and act on critical information.
-That's what _G Suite_ does,
-,_G Suite_ enhances information sharing and collaboration.
-Machine learning finds previously hidden patterns in data,
-,new information which helps businesses improve their products,
-,and better serve their customers.

-So I'm really excited by the progress here,
-,and I can't wait to see what you all build next.

-So without further delay, I'm going to invite Diane back onto the stage.
-She joined us in late 2015,
-,and the business has grown dramatically for us under her leadership.
-Given that it's also _International Women's Day_,
-,it's also a pleasure to welcome back on stage,
-,a trail blazer for women in technology.

-So let's have Diane back, to share more about how Google Cloud is helping all of you.
-,thank you.
